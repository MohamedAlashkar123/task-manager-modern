# Security Improvements

## Issues Fixed

### 1. WebSocket Connection Security
- **Problem**: WebSocket connections exposed API keys in browser console and network requests
- **Solution**: Disabled realtime subscriptions in client-side code and implemented secure server-side API routes

### 2. API Key Exposure
- **Problem**: Supabase API keys were visible in client-side JavaScript
- **Solution**: 
  - Moved sensitive operations to server-side API routes
  - Created separate server and client Supabase clients
  - Only expose anonymous keys with Row Level Security (RLS)

### 3. Logging Security
- **Problem**: Sensitive information (API keys, URLs) exposed in console logs
- **Solution**: Implemented secure logging utility that automatically sanitizes sensitive patterns

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Row Level Security (RLS)
- Enabled RLS on all database tables (tasks, notes, rpa_processes)
- Created policies to ensure users can only access their own data
- Added automatic user_id assignment for new records

### 2. Server-Side API Routes
- Created secure API endpoints for all database operations
- Server-side authentication and authorization
- Proper error handling without exposing sensitive information

### 3. Secure Environment Variables
```bash
# Public (safe to expose)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key

# Private (server-side only)
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
```

### 4. Secure Logging
- Automatic sanitization of API keys, tokens, and URLs
- Pattern-based detection of sensitive information
- Safe logging utility for development and production

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Security Setup
Run the `database-security-setup.sql` script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- This script will:
-- 1. Enable RLS on all tables
-- 2. Create user-specific access policies
-- 3. Add user_id columns with proper constraints
-- 4. Create triggers for automatic user_id assignment
```

### 2. Environment Variables
Update your `.env.local` file with the secure configuration provided above.

### 3. API Key Management
- **Never commit API keys to version control**
- Use `.env.local` for local development
- Use secure environment variable management in production
- Regularly rotate API keys

## Security Best Practices

### 1. Client-Side Security
- Only expose anonymous keys to the client
- All sensitive operations happen server-side
- Implement proper authentication flows
- Use HTTPS in production

### 2. Database Security
- RLS policies enforce data isolation
- Proper indexing for performance with user filtering
- Regular security audits of database permissions

### 3. Logging Security
- Use `secureConsole` instead of regular `console` methods
- Automatic sanitization prevents accidental exposure
- Development-only debug logging

### 4. API Security
- Server-side validation and authorization
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Rate limiting (implement as needed)

## Migration Steps

If you're updating an existing application:

1. Run the database security setup script
2. Update environment variables
3. Replace direct Supabase calls with API route calls
4. Update all logging to use secure logging utility
5. Test thoroughly in development environment
6. Deploy with secure environment variable configuration

## Monitoring

- Monitor for any remaining console warnings about WebSocket connections
- Check that no API keys appear in browser network requests
- Verify RLS policies are working correctly
- Regular security audits of logs and database access
